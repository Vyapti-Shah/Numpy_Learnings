It helps in dealing with axis
NumPy provides efficient storage an better ways of handling data for processing
It uses less memory to store data (great space complexity)
It is fast (great time complexity)

5 methods top create numpy array
 1. Conversion from other Python structures (eg. lists, tuples)
 2. Intrinsic numpy array creation objects (eg. arange, ones, zeros, etc.)
 3. Reading arrays from disk, either from standard or custom formats 
 4. Creating arrays from raw bytes through the use of strings or buffers
 5. Use of special library functions (eg. random)
